### 1st Use Case. Manage Data Evolution. FINISH FOR NEXT LAB
	 work with default tables.
	→ I have 4 tables (instead of only one in p2), 4 sub-use cases: 1º manage Countries 2º manage drives 3º manage gp 4ºmanage teams
	• to do: create a class diagram from User ------ Manage Countries
	
	(Same as project 2 but replacing people with countries, GPs, drivers... etc.)

	• then, update this diagram by adding Drivers, Teams and GPs to this schema
	→ once I do that, 1st Use Case is completed
